# Selenium_project

This project includes some Test Cases using Selenium Web Driver. 

In the folder "First Test cases" you can find my first steps with Selenium and case about Registration of the new user with empty data on the web page. There are some simple examples. 

In the folder "Test Cases with Page Objects" you can find my next test cases about searching on the web page, also about adding product to the cart and assertion of the alert message. In these cases I used Page Objects with some parts of the case and that generally test case could be more compact. Every Page includes some function which we can to use more times in next cases. This is useful. 

In the folder "Test Case Login" you can find two test cases about Passed and Failed login on the web page of the shop. Every test case includes Assertion which confirms that User logged successful or User could not login and appeared appropriate Error about Incorrect login details. In two cases tests passed.
